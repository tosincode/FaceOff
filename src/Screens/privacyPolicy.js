        <RegularText>Your California Rights</RegularText>
        <View style={styles.description}>
          <RegularText style={styles.subDescription}>
          A California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (“California customer”) is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.
          </RegularText>
          <RegularText style={styles.subDescription}>
          In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a California customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed.
          </RegularText>
          <RegularText style={styles.subDescription}>
          However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing customer’s personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy.
          </RegularText>
          <RegularText style={styles.subDescription}>
          Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right.
          </RegularText>
          <RegularText style={styles.subDescription}>
          As stated in our Privacy Policy, we do not share information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure. If you do ask us to share your information with a third party for its marketing purposes, we will only share information in connection with that specific promotion, as we do not share information with any third party on a continual basis.
          </RegularText>
          <RegularText style={styles.subDescription}>
          To prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt in to such use when you provide personally identifiable information on one of our sites. Please note that whenever you opt in to receive future communications from a third party, your information will be subject to the third party's privacy policy.
          </RegularText>
          <RegularText style={styles.subDescription}>
          If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use information. You should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your information.
          </RegularText>
          <RegularText style={styles.subDescription}>
          California customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by contacting us. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than e-mail.
